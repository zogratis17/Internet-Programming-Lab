    an important textile-manufacturing centre, is sometimes refered as ’Manchester of South India’. 
    There are over a hundred textile mills in the Coimbatore region apart from numerous other manufacturing units of engineering equipment and electronic items. 
    Coimbatore’s history dates back to the 2nd century AD when it was a small tribal village called Kongunad. 
    The first of the early Cholas, Karikalan brought Kongunad under Chola control. 
    The Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas, Hoysalas. Pandyas, and the Vijayanagara have all ruled over the city.
